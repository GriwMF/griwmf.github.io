This illustrates me before and after January. These are also the guts of my EcoFlow after meeting counter current. It was the combined result of my own mistake and the grid electricity coming back on 3 hours earlier than scheduled. While waiting for spare parts to arrive, I wonder if I'll be able to fix it. I guess only God knows.

Anyway, that is just the tip of the iceberg. This was definitely one of the longest months of my life. It startrd with New Year's celebrations and meeting friends, but then I had to explain some account activity to the bank. On top of that, I had my diploma defense, a trip to Kyiv, and a lot of worries - both reasonable and irrational.

I did start this blog! I also built a waybar plugin to display the EcoFlow battery status. It turned out to be much harder than expected due to API limitations and inconsistencies. Ironically, the very next day, my EcoFlow "exploded".

I'm pretty sure I've forgotten half of the things that happened, but at least I've blogged about the other half. Even if nobody reads it, it's a good way to keep track of my life.

As for February, I have no idea what to expect. I think I just need a break to get myself together.
